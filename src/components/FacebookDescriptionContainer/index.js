            <p>UX is one of the most important pillars for successful Facebook Ads projects.
                This means your banners must be planned to fit both desktop and mobile websites.</p>

            <span>Different types of ads on Facebook</span>

            <p>Zuckerberg’s brightest creation has its way of keeping people in it. Therefore, marketing strategies must be designed considering that the public you want to
            reach is probably scrolling down through Facebook right now.
          <br></br>
              <br></br>
              But that’s old news.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              The thing is that, in order to really reach your audience, your product must be well displayed. And which is the best way to do so?
                Facebook currently supports a number of different types of ads, from photos to vídeos. You can also create carousel, slideshow and dynamic product ads.
                <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Of course, creating them all takes time, effort and human resources: valuable items to any successful company.</p>

            <p>Now that you know what you’re dealing with, it is time to get down to business. Set the language, choose your animation style and get your pixels right. But of
            course, decide the position of your ad. Is it a right column ad or a carousel one? Your choice directly affects the size of your banner and how you place the
            information.
          <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Also, Facebook’s “stories” feature brings yet a new way of advertising on the platform. And that means new sizes and measures.
