            <p>The hashtag machine dressed up as a blue bird may actually be much more interesting to brands than we are used to thinking.
            As we focus on Facebook and Instagram ads making, Twitter ends up being used only as a B2C organic interaction platform.
But it could be much more</p>

              It’s pretty simple to be eligible for Twitter Ads. You just need high quality static profile picture and header. In case you use a URL that point to your product, it must
also be active in your bio.

            <p>If you’ve ever struggled with Twitter header dimensions, know that you’re not alone… So here are some tips to look good in front of your followers.
            <br></br>
              <br></br>

            </p>
            <span>Twitter header size</span>
            <p>
              To avoid having your header design resized (cause that absolutely sucks!), the exact dimensions are 1263 x 421 pixels. The size that Twitter recommends is
              1500 x 500 pixels.
              
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Remember that your profile picture is above your banner design, so be sure you are not using that space.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            All this area has been delimited as profile picture because that’s the space where it can move around as the window being used gets resized.
            
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Yeah, twitter banner dimensions are not that easy, huh? No worries, we can do that for you.
