            <span>What are Instagram Ads?</span>

            <p>Instagram ads may look like regular posts, but they are way more than that.
          <br></br>
              <br></br>
              That’s because they may be designed to talk to your target specifically. You just need to have a Facebook Business account.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Since IG offers more than just one format for advertisement, one of the biggest challenges is to find the ideal size for your banner.

            <p>The platform usually recommends 1936 x 1936 pixels for maximum banner impact. However, when it comes to stories, it is all about time: with about 120 seconds
            to leave your message, the clue is to go for high quality photos and videos.
